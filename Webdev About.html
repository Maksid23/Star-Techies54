One needs to use money several times that has ultimately no meaning. Accidents can lead to destruction of certain families. Here Virtual Machine Health Assistant comes into action.It is a web service in which the proposed system tries to eliminate users need to figure out their problem with the machine health by giving them access to a centralized mechanic repository in a much interactive manner. Users can also ask questions regarding their problems and even book online and offline appointments with mechanics.
            Our Webservice stores the machine record of the user on a remote server. User can enter their problem and our System try to figure out it and give the immediate action that the user can take. In the end, a precise solution is generated. What this Webservice can’t ensure is the accuracy of the machine condition that the service arrived at, and thus in such cases, more efficient mechanic must be contacted.
